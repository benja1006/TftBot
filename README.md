"# TftBot" 
TFT bot is an attempt at automating sharing some information between two teammates in a game called teamfight-tactics. It uses a very simple model to look at the screen and determine what characters are on it, then it can pass that information to an interface. It is written in python using tensorflow and pytesseract for CV and OCR tasks.
